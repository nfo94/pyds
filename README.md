### Data structures & Algorithms with Python

This is a study repository for data structures and algorithms using Python.


#### Big O

Mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and
space complexity.

Time complexity: analyze the number of operations that that algorithm took to execute.

Space complexity: analyze the amount of memory used in that algorithm.
